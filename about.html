  <div class="paras">
    <p class="s2p1">-  I am originally from Greenville South Carolina. Relatively new to the world of programming, I have an extensive background in business and finance. For undergrad, I attended Wofford College in Spartanburg South Carolina where I earned a Bachelor's in Finance. Following my studies at Wofford, I worked several years in the sales finance industry, underwriting automobile and direct consumer loans.</p>

    <p class="s2p2">-  After determining that the world of consumer loans just wasn't the right place for me, I decided to go back to school, and graduated from the University of South Carolina's International MBA program with a concentration in finance & investment management. This was a great period in my life in which I learned much about business and myself; however, I felt that I was exploring an industry that ultimately was not going to be fulfilling neither personally nor professionally.</p>

    <p class="s2p3">-  Which brings me to The Iron Yard Academy. With some experience working with several early-age startups, coupled with a passion for learning and an undeniable interest in technology, I decided to enroll in the front end engineering course. The rest they say, is history. I am now in love with programming, being able to build unqie tangibles that people use on a daily basis, and the feeling of contributing to an exciting, dynamic industry that continues to evolve in front of my very eyes.</p>

    <p class="s2p4">-  In short, I am now so pleased to be making cool and original stuff on the web, as well as have the ability to help businesses and individuals evolve and adapt in the ever-changing digital world.</p>
